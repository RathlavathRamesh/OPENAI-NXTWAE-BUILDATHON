Hazards: Severe, fast-flowing, muddy riverine flooding. Complete collapse of a multi-story building into the flooded river. Significant erosion of the riverbank where the building stood. Large amount of water spray and debris immediately following the collapse.
People/vehicles/resources: No people or vehicles are visible in the immediate area of the collapse or in the water.
Location hints: Residential or commercial buildings visible on the riverbanks, suggesting a populated area.
Blockages and accessibility issues: The river is a major obstacle due to the extreme flooding. The collapse of the building implies structural instability and potential damage to adjacent areas or infrastructure, though no specific roads or bridges are clearly shown.
Severity: High.
