Visual:
Hazards: Severe flash flooding with extremely high, rapid, and turbulent muddy water. Complete collapse of a multi-story building into the floodwaters, creating a large dust/mist cloud. Significant erosion of the riverbank is evident where the building collapsed, and other nearby buildings appear to be at risk.
People/vehicles/resources: None visible.
Location hints: A settlement with multiple buildings built along what appears to be a riverbank or hillside adjacent to a river. No specific signage or landmarks.
Blockages and accessibility issues: The destroyed building and ongoing powerful floodwaters render the affected area inaccessible and dangerous. Roads or bridges that might have existed in the immediate vicinity are likely compromised or destroyed.
Severity: High.
